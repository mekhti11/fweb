            <p>Chloe Bennet was born Chloe Wang in Chicago,
            Illinois, to Stephanie, an internist, and Bennet Wang.
            Her father is of Chinese descent. As a teenager, she
            moved to Beijing to pursue a singing career. While she
            was there, she studied Mandarin, learned the demands of
            international pop stardom and released her debut single,
            "Uh Oh", in both English and Mandarin.</p>
            <p>Chloe Bennet grew up on the Southside of Chicago, in Obama’s
            neighborhood. Her father is first generation Chinese-American
            and her mother is Caucasian. Chloe’s family consists
            of six brothers: three siblings are biological and three siblings
            are adopted (African-American and Mexican respectively). Additionally
            and to this day, during any given year, you may find foster and
            foreign exchange students living in Chloe’s home; her story is a real
            life multicultural Cosby Show.</p>

            <p>Chloe is an outgoing and gregarious young girl who was first educated in
            the Montessori system. There she developed a love of performing and
            singing. At the age of 12, she joined the Second City Youth Ensemble
            where she studied acting and improv. At 15, she was discovered by a
            music manager who immediately signed her and arranged for her to move to
            China where she lived with her paternal grandmother and began intensive
            mandarin studies in Shanghai. During this time, she began making
            regular trips to Sweden to record with the same songwriters and
            producers behind Britney Spears, Miley Cyrus, Celine Dion,
            Jennifer Lopez, Madonna, etc.</p>
            <p>Based on the success of her “Uh Oh” video, Chloe was invited to perform at the Zebra music festival, a three-day charity event to benefit victims of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Over 30,000 people were in attendance and the event was broadcast to over 100 million homes in China. It was Chloe’s first live performance wherein she emerged as one of the most impressive acts on the bill.</p>

            <p>Her performance at the Zebra Muisc Festival led to a number of commercial opportunities and an onslaught of press coverage. She has been featured in print advertising and on billboards throughout China. She has also been sponsored in China by Nike, Ports 1961 and Umbro, and has likewise been featured in various fashion and lifestyle articles in Chinese Vogue, Elle, In Style, Cosmopolitan, China Daily, and numerous other Chinese publications.</p>
            <p>In the summer of 2010, Chloe landed her first role as a co-host on the new Teen Nick television show, The Nightlife. Recently, Chloe has been a guest star on ABC’s Nashville and is currently co-starring in Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</p>

            <p>Chloe was born on April 18, 1992, which makes her an Aries. Read all
              about her astrological sign below.</p>
            <p>Aries is the first sign of the zodiac, and that’s pretty much how those born under this sign see themselves: first. Aries are the leaders of the pack, first in line to get things going. Whether or not everything gets done is another question altogether, for an Aries prefers to initiate rather than to complete. Do you have a project needing a kick-start? Call an Aries, by all means. The leadership displayed by Aries is most impressive, so don’t be surprised if they can rally the troops against seemingly insurmountable odds — they have that kind of personal magnetism. An Aries won’t shy away from new ground, either. Those born under this sign are often called the pioneers of the zodiac, and it’s their fearless trek into the unknown that often wins the day. Aries is a bundle of energy and dynamism, kind of like a Pied Piper, leading people along with its charm and charisma. The dawning of a new day — and all of its possibilities — is pure bliss to an Aries.</p>
